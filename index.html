      <p>
        Hi, I'm Isaiah Swank. I'm graduating in Spring 2025 with my BS in Software Engineering. I am the second oldest of nine kids so my whole life has been spent managing a team.
        On a more serious note I love teamwork, solving problems, and making the most of the situation I am given. In my free time I like to play/watch sports, spend time with loved ones, and make games.
        I am looking to contribute my skills to a company to not only grow my own skills, but hopefully produce great products customers will love. Below you can see my resume and some of the projects I have worked on!

        <h3> MealsMyWay - NAU 2024 Engineering Fest 1st Place</h3>
        <p>
          This is my Senior Capstone project. It is a Meal Prepping Web and Mobile application with focus on maximum flexibility for the user and reducing food waste. I am the team lead for this project and have a range of responsibilities.
          For the product aspect, I designed the Service Oriented Architecture that the system is using, am in charge of designing the UI/UX of the system, as well as the functionality for the calendar features.
          On the management side I am in charge of communicating with the client, arranging meetings with the client and weekly as a team, and properly delegating tasks among team members to maximize team strength. We are currently in the Pre-Alpha stage approaching Alpha.

        <h3>Generative AI Blackjack Teacher - V1</h3>
        <p>
          This python project is a playable Blackjack game that teaches you how to count cards (using pygame). The goal of this project is learning how to integrate generative AI (Deepseek in this scenario) into a system.
          Currently, I have a playable UI using art I created that keeps track of the running count and true count. I am still working on/learning how to integrate the AI, but after many iterations the game is completely playable outside of that.

        <h3> Boggle with AI Solver</h3>
        <p>
          This is a playable word solving game made in Python using pygame. It is similar to the game Boggle but without the timer. You can try for as long as you want to find all of the words; but if you press the give up button
          it will show you all of the possible words from the current board. The program uses a BFS to search all the possible moves on the board to ensure completeness.
          It dynamically displays the words in alphabetical order and updates the score and word list. After it is done it pauses for 5 seconds for the user to see the max score, then it resets so you can play again.

          <h3>Mission Demolition - Discount Angry Birds</h3>
          <p>
            This project is a mission demoltion game built in Unity. The goal is to fire projectiles at the targets to hit the green targets.
            The focus for me on this game was good level design and how to make engaging power ups/features. I implemented a speed boost feature as well as a split projectile feature, both which activate only on specific levels.
            The video below shows a play through of the game with verbal explanation of the features.

        <h3>Karate Time - HTML5 Fighter Game</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first ever game project, I coded this using HTML5, CSS, and JS. I created all of the art and animations which is why the girl characters animation is buggy. I learned the importance of creating spritesheets with equivilant spacing and sizing in order to do proper calculations for the animation.
          This lesson also translated into how hitboxes worked. I made the hitbox match the width of the characters, which also was buggy due to the charcters different sizing and one method for creating the hitbox. If I were to go back 
          and work on this again, I would redesign the characters to make sure they are the same size, as well as create a seperate CSS file to handle all of the styling that is currently hard coded into HTML. While this isn't my best project, it is my first and I am proud of how I have used the lessons here to improve my other works.
